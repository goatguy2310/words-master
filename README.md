If the word in the Text Field makes sense (i.e. is an English word), when you click on the Submit Button, you will gain points. The longer the word, the more points you gain.
Otherwise, click the Delete Button to delete the last letter and return it to the grid.

The game has a time limit of 30s. Every time a correct word is submitted, it resets to 30s. If it runs out before any correct word is given, the game ends.
